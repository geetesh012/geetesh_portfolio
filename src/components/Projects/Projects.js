              description="Developed a full-stack app to analyze and predict social media trends using machine learning. Built a FastAPI backend to serve ML models and a Streamlit frontend for real-time interaction. Used DistilBERT for sentiment analysis and trained trend prediction models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) on tweet metadata. Integrated NLP and classification pipelines to detect trending topics, sentiment polarity, and forecast trend longevity."
